    <h2>What is Huangcoin?</h2>
    <p>Huangcoin (HNC) is another peer-to-peer digital currency, but HNC is slightly different.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>How is Huangcoin different?</h3>
    <p>Instead of being designed for the open market of the world, HNC was designed for use in the HTwins Central Discord server, and other HTwins services</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why use Huangcoin?</h2>
    <p>The prime reason someone would want to use HNC would be to perform transactions within HTwins communities. If you wished to use it for another purpose you could, but why?</p>
